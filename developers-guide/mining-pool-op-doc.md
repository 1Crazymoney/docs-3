# BCH Mining Pool Operation Doc

In order to vote for specific validator in SmartBch, BCH Mining Pool should write the smartBch validator consensus pubkey in its coinbase Tx's first vout.

The `vout` should be like this:

```
vout:
{
	"value":0.00000000,
	 n":1,
"scriptPubKey":
	{
		"asm":"OP_RETURN 7342434800" + "consensus_pubkey_hex_string"
	}
}
```

Just care about `asm`, it is a string joint of "OP_RETURN 7342434800" and "consensus_pubkey_hex_string" 

The `consensus_pubkey_hex_string` is your SmartBch validator' s consensus pubkey, which is generated by command below:

```
./smartbchd generate-consensus-key-info |tee generate-consensus-key-info.txt
a07871d10858179c1bb3c1f0d7bab31103135b76f96b6bd1f06a5bc0d350f862
```

So, if a minning pool want voting for this validator, he should set first vout's asm in his coinbase as below:

```
OP_RETURN 7342434800a07871d10858179c1bb3c1f0d7bab31103135b76f96b6bd1f06a5bc0d350f862
```
